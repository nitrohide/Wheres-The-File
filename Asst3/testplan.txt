how to run the test cases from testcase.txt
1) first run make
2) input port number

./WTFserver 9123
 will run the server on port 9123

3)chdir() function will change the working directory

WTFtest.c tests all the functions in the test cases.
1)The client is initailize by making a .configure file
2)CREATE a project called "initializedestroy"
3)DESTROY project "initializedestroy"
4)CREATE another project "TestProject"
5)ADD 3 files
6)REMOVE 1 file
7)COMMIT the changes to the server
8)server responds successful commit
9)PUSH the changes to the server
10)STDOUT prints all changes
11)CURRENTVERSION is tested successfully
12)REMOVE project from client
13)call CHECKOUT successfully, server clones project into client repository
14)call UPDATE with cloned repository, client prints "Up to Date"
15)call UPGRADE, prints .Update is empty, client is up to date
16)call HISTORY, prints all the changes 
17)call ROLLBACK, reverts TestProject to version 1

WTFtest.c essentially tests all successful cases of testcases.txt
